## README
**Artwork Gallery** showcases all track album artwork from your Spotify Discover Weekly playlist! This is made possible with Python, Spotify's API, and some fun with self refreshing authorization tokens and in-browser viewing. When run, your default browser will appear and take you through every track's album artwork.

Note: Be sure to fill in all empty values within the *secrets.py* for your Spotify instance before running.
